# Huffman-Compression

This project was written for my algorithms class summer 2012. </br>
The purpose was to achieve high compression while at the same time </br>
getting fast compression. 

<h1>Instructions</h1></br>
<p>The program starts by asking the name of the file you wish to compress</p>
<p>followed by asking the name of the file you want to store the compressed information onto.</p>
<p>The 3rd and final item is asks for is the name of the file that will test if the decoder did its job well</p>
